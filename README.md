# pulumi-esc-tf-integration

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Terraform and Pulumi ESC for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) using Python. Focus lies within the usage of Pulumi ESC as a central configuration service replacing variable files or any other kind of dependency modelling between two terraform configurations.

This repository is a by-product of the blog post available at [Techdecline Blog](https://blog.techdecline.dev/dependency-management-in-infrastructure-as-code-part-two).
